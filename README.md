# Projects

In this repository, you will find some practical project attempts made in the following languages: Java, C++ and Javascript. It is worth mentioning that the files here were created by an enthusiastic programmer who wants to learn as much as possible about the language. 🖖😎🖖

If you find any errors, feel free to make a Pull Request for changes. Any correction will be considered a welcome help! 🫰😁🫰

(⚠️ As I am a beginner in programming, the codes may contain many errors, so it is not advisable to copy them or use them beyond the didactic form.⚠️)
